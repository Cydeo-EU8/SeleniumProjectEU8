PIQ: What is the difference between Implicit wait and explicit wait?
-> Implicit wait time is set once globally and applies to all steps.
-> Explicit wait is applied to a specific element on the page

-> Implicit wait works with findElement method and waits until element is present in html/dom (document object model)
-> Explicit wait can be applied with different conditions that are available in ExpectedConditions class

-> Implicit wait stops waiting as soon as element is found in the html/dom
-> Explicit wait stops waiting when certain condition is met. like visibility of elem. or enable of elem etc

-> Implicit wait throws NoSuchElementException if element does not appear in html/dom during the timeout
-> Explicit wait throws TimeOutException if condition is not met within the specified seconds
